//! # clifford-ast
//!
//! Shared AST types for the Clifford compiler. Implements §3 (Parser
//! Behavior) of `docs/CLIFFORD_SPEC.md` — specifically the AST node kinds
//! catalogued there.
//!
//! ## Why a separate crate
//!
//! The AST is consumed by every phase from `parser` onward. Putting it in its
//! own crate (rather than re-exporting from `parser`) keeps the dependency
//! pipeline clean (per CLAUDE.md §2: no backward edges) and lets `resolve`,
//! `types`, `check`, etc. depend on AST without depending on the parser.
//!
//! ## Sigil layer is preserved on every node
//!
//! Per §3 of the spec and Decision #1 (sigil layering), the parser stamps
//! every item and statement with its sigil layer (`@` functional, `#`
//! imperative). That stamp lives on the AST node and is consumed by
//! `clifford-check` (§5.5) to enforce the cross-boundary rules without
//! re-scanning source.
//!
//! ## Implementation status
//!
//! First slice (this PR): the [`Program`] / [`Item`] / [`FnDecl`] /
//! [`AutomatonDecl`] skeleton. Items carry name + span only — bodies,
//! parameters, return types, trait lists, automaton fields, transitions,
//! effects all come in subsequent slices alongside their parser
//! implementations.
